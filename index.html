<i>Math for Data Science</i> covers the elements of linear algebra, probability, statistics, and calculus most relevant to data science. Applications include dimensionality reduction, machine learning, optimization techniques, neural network training, stochastic gradient descent, square and logistic regression, and accelerated methods.
Throughout, Python code is woven into the narrative, to be experienced <em> in vivo </em> --- alive within context, not examined <em> in vitro.</em>
All code is posted above under <a href='/files'><i>Files</i></a>.
Also included are nine appendices providing background material and additional context, and 466 exercises.
